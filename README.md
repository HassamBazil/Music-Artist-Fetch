# App Description

Web app built using HTML, CSS and Pure JS that gets an artist's name from the user and fetches their information and upcoming events using bandsintown public API.

# Design
I went for a very minimalistic look using blue and white colors that represents Motive for me.

# Technologies
As advised during my last interview, I made the app using pure JS. For styling, I also just used CSS but used bootstrap for its grid functionality.
